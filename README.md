# Book-Recommender-Website
This project is a Book Recommendation System developed using Machine Learning, Flask (for the backend), and HTML/CSS (for the frontend). The website provides personalized books based on user preferences.

Key Features:

Personalized Recommendations: The system suggests books to users based on their previous selections or preferences using a machine learning model.
Interactive User Interface: A simple and clean UI built with HTML and CSS to make it easy for users to input their preferences and view recommendations.
Flask Backend: The Flask framework is used to handle user requests, process inputs, and serve the appropriate book recommendations.
Machine Learning Model: A recommender system built using popular algorithms such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models to generate book suggestions.


Technologies Used:

Flask: For handling server-side logic and creating the backend API.
HTML/CSS: For creating a responsive and user-friendly frontend interface.
Machine Learning: Various algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) to make accurate book recommendations based on user inputs.
Python Libraries:
Pandas/NumPy for data processing.
Scikit-learn or other ML libraries for building the recommendation model.


How it Works:

Data Collection: The system can either fetch books data from an external source (e.g., an API like Google Books or an in-house dataset) or be populated with a pre-existing list of books.
User Interaction: Users can input their preferences, such as favorite genres, authors, or previous books they've read.
Book Recommendation: Based on user input, the system will use the machine learning model to suggest books.
Recommendation Output: The system displays a list of recommended books, along with details like titles, authors, and cover images.
